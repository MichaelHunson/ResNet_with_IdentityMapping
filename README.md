# Python script implementation of Residual 50/101/152-layer Network with Identity Mapping based on Caffe
<img src="http://7xrja7.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/identity_mapping_resnet.png" alt="residual net structure image" width="200px" /></br>
the new net structure is given in this figure, in which we can see that **BN** layer and **ReLU** layer are stacked before weight layer. This script provide simple way to choose the layer to generate:</br>
<pre lang=python>
layer_50_layer = (3, 4, 6, 3) #50 layers
layer_101_layer = (3, 4,  23, 3) #101 layers
layer_152_layer = (3, 8, 38, 3) #152 layers
</pre>
This script generates train/test layer separately. If you want to generate the layer for model training, or model testing, you have to slight modify the script.

#Miscellaneous
1. I appreciate [Soeaver](https://github.com/soeaver/caffe-model) for the initial inspiration to write this code.
2. Layers generated by this script have been tested on ImageNet.
3. Any suggestion or tip is welcome to drop to yuhanghe@whu.edu.cn.
4. This script is based on paper **Identity Mapping in Deep Residual Networks**
